A browser extension which helps you refresh all the tabs!

## Usage

As of version `1.1.1` you are able to set options for the extension: 

- Include Tabs with Audio (default: `Off`):  This setting allows refreshing only tabs that are not audible.  Refresh your tabs while not interrupting your music!
