A browser extension which helps you refresh all the tabs!

## Usage

Either click the extension icon, or use the keyboard shortcut (default: `Ctrl-Shift-5`) to refresh all tabs in the open window.

You are able to set some options for the extension: 

- Include Tabs with Audio (default: `Off`):  This setting allows refreshing only tabs that are not audible.  Refresh your tabs while not interrupting your music!  

- Always bypass cache (default: `Off`):  Control whether you want to bypass cache whenever Super Refresh is invoked.

The Chrome version also works fine with Edge Chromium and other Chromium browsers.  

### Firefox

*Why?  Firefox was at roughly 5% market share at the origination of the development of this extension and has since that time nearly **halved** its market share.  [Chrome won. (2017)](https://chromeunboxed.com/former-mozilla-cto-chrome-won-the-browser-wars/)*
